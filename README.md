# 2Market Customer & Marketing Analytics (SQL)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyses customer behaviour and marketing campaign performance for the
**2Market dataset** using SQL. The objective is to understand how customer value,
demographics, geography, and advertising exposure influence campaign response and
conversion.

The analysis focuses on answering practical business questions and translating SQL outputs
into clear, actionable insights.

---

## 📌 Executive Summary
This analysis shows that customer behaviour and campaign effectiveness vary significantly
across demographic, geographic, and marketing dimensions.

Key findings indicate that:
- A small group of high-value customers contributes a disproportionate share of total spend
- Campaign response rates differ by country and income level
- Digital advertising channels outperform traditional channels
- Customers exposed to multiple advertising channels are significantly more likely to respond

These insights support a data-driven marketing strategy focused on high-value customers,
digital channels, and coordinated multi-channel campaigns to improve conversion rates and
marketing ROI.
